### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete member 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete member 1` Command](images/UpdatedDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/FinalModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />



The `Model` component:

* stores the address book data, i.e. all `Person` and `Event` objects (contained in a `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueEventList` respectively within the `AddressBook`).
* stores user-defined command shortcuts in an `AliasBook`, which maps alias words to actual command words.
* maintains filtered views of both members and events (`FilteredList<Person>` and `FilteredList<Event>`).  
  These are exposed to the outside as unmodifiable `ObservableList`s so that the UI can automatically update when the underlying data changes.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the userâ€™s GUI settings, file paths, and other user-specific preferences.  
  This is exposed externally as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other components (as the `Model` represents core data entities that should make sense on their own).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Role` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique role, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/UpdatedBetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/FinalStorageClassDiagram.png" width="750" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data, alias book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `AliasBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

The address book JSON structure contains two top-level arrays: `persons` and `events`. Each `person` is serialized via `JsonAdaptedPerson`, and each `event` via `JsonAdaptedEvent`.

Example (abridged):

```
{
  "persons": [
    { "name": "Alex Yeoh", "phone": "87438807", "email": "alexyeoh@u.nus.edu", "year": "1", "roles": [] }
  ],
  "events": [
    { "name": "Welcome Tea", "date": "2025-12-30T18:00", "venue": "COM1-01" }
  ]
}
```
The alias book JSON structure contains one-level array: `alias`. Each `alias` is serialized via `JsonAdaptedAlias`.

Example (abridged):

```
{
  "aliases" : [ {
    "commandWord" : "delete",
    "aliasWord" : "d"
  } ]
}
```

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Alias feature

#### Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: NUS CCA leaders

* has a need to manage a significant number of member contacts
* needs to track CCA members' attendance for event participation
* classify members into their different roles
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps


**Value proposition**: keep track of members and events easily with simple one-line commands. Record
attendance for members and filter members by event attendance.

**MSS**

1. User performs [<u>UC1: list members</u>](#use-case-list-members).
2. User performs [<u>UC2: list events</u>](#use-case-list-events).
3. User requests to unmark a particular member's attendance for a particular event.
4. ComClubConnect unmarks the attendance of the member as requested by user.
5. ComClubConnect confirms that the member's attendance for the event was unmarked.
   Use case ends.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` installed.
2.  The system should be able to handle at least 50 members and 20 events without noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  Core commands (add, delete, list) should return results within 1 second for datasets within these limits.
4.  Error messages should be clear, specific, and actionable, guiding the user to correct invalid inputs.
5.  Member and event records must be stored persistently so that no data is lost between application restarts.
6.  The system must validate all input to prevent injection of unsupported or malicious characters.
7.  The application should start up and be ready to accept commands within 5 seconds on a typical laptop.
8.  All stored data should be in a human-readable text format (e.g., JSON/XML/CSV) so that it can be migrated easily to another system if needed.


### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A visual interface that allows users to interact with the application through elements like buttons, menus, and windows instead of typing commands.
* **Address Book**: A digital contact management system that stores details of CCA members (e.g., name, phone, email, role).
* **Index**: A numerical identifier assigned to members or events in a displayed list, used for referencing in commands (e.g., delete member 2).
* **Command**: A specific instruction entered by the user into the CLI to perform an action (e.g., add n/John Doe â€¦, delete member 1).
* **Persistence**: The ability of the system to save data (members and events) so that it remains available across multiple sessions.
* **Error Message**: A feedback response from the system that informs the user about invalid or incorrect inputs (e.g., invalid phone number, missing parameters).
* **Command Line Interface(CLI)**: A text-based user interface where users type in commands (e.g., add, delete, list) instead of using graphical menus.
* **Member**: An individual registered in the CCA with details such as name, contact number, email, and role.

testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1a. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1b. Double-click the jar file 
       Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   2a. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2b. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Adding a member/event

1. Adding a new member/event

   1a. Prerequisites: None.

   1b. Test case 1: `add member n/Jean Doe p/98765432 e/jean@u.nus.edu y/2 r/President`<br>
   Expected: Jean Doe is added into the member's list. Details of the added member shown in the status message.

   1c. Test case 2: `add event n/Orientation d/2025-08-01T18:00 v/NUS`<br>
   Expected: Event Orientation is added into the event's list. Details of the added event shown in the status message.

   1d. Invalid test case: `add member n/ p/`<br>
   Expected: Error message displayed indicating missing required fields.

   1e. Other incorrect add commands to try: `add`, `add n/`, `...` <br>
   Expected: Similar to previous.
2. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Deleting a member/event

1. Deleting a member/event while all members/events are being shown

   1a. Prerequisites: List all members/events using the `list members`/`list events` command. Multiple members/events in the list.

   1b. Test case 1: `delete member 1`<br>
       Expected: First member is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted member shown in the status message.

   1c. Test case 2: `delete event 1`<br>
       Expected: First event is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted event shown in the status message.

   1d. Test case 3: `delete member 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1e. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.
2. _{ more test cases â€¦â€‹ }_

### Listing members/events

1. Viewing all members/events

   1a. Test case 1: `list members`<br>
   Expected: All members are displayed in the list.

   1b. Test case 2: `list events`<br>
   Expected: All events are displayed in the list.

   1c. Other incorrect list commands to try: `list`, `list x`<br>
   Expected: Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
